## riscv-none-elf-gcc

After installing the toolchain, the result is a large set of programs
prefixed by `riscv-none-elf-`. For those used to other RISC-V
toolchains, there is no `riscv64-` or `riscv32-` prefix since
the word size is
actually not needed, the RISC-V toolchain produces both 32/64-bit binaries,
based on `-march` and `-mabi`.

### `-march` and `-mabi`

The RISC-V CPU is not defined as a single architecture, but as a family of
architectures, with optional extensions, identified by letters.

RISC-V ISA strings begin with either RV32I, RV32E, RV64I, or RV128I,
the numerical value
indicating the register size in bits for the base integer ISA.

- RV32I: A load-store ISA with 32 general-purpose integer registers of 32-bit
- RV32E: An embedded flavour of RV32I with only 16 integer registers of 32-bit
- RV64I: A 64-bit flavour of RV32I where the general-purpose integer registers
  are 64-bit wide.

In addition to these base ISAs, a large number of extensions have been
specified. The most used extensions that have both been specified
and are supported by the toolchain are:

- M: Integer Multiplication and Division
- A: Atomics
- F: Single-Precision Floating-Point
- D: Double-Precision Floating-Point
- C: 16-bit Compressed Instructions
- Zicsr: Control and Status Register (CSR)
- Zifencei: Instruction-Fetch Fence
- G: General, a shortcut to IMAFD, Zicsr, Zifencei

RISC-V ISA strings are defined by appending the supported extensions to the
base ISA in the order listed above. For example, the RISC-V ISA with
32-bit integer registers and the instructions to for multiplication would
be denoted as "RV32IM". Users can control the set of instructions that GCC
uses when generating assembly code by passing the lower-case ISA string to
the `-march` GCC option: for example `-march=rv32imac`.

There are some other extensions. For more details, please see
[The RISC-V ISA Specification, Volume I: Unprivileged Spec](https://riscv.org/specifications/).

In addition to controlling the instructions used by GCC during code
generation, users can select from various ABIs (which define
the calling convention and layout of objects in memory).
It is recommended for objects and
libraries to follow the same ABI, and not rely on the toolchain
logic for matching multilibs.

RISC-V defines two integer ABIs and three floating-point ABIs, which
together are treated as a single ABI string. The integer ABIs follow the
standard ABI naming scheme:

- `ilp32`: "int", "long", and pointers are all 32-bit long. "long long" is
  a 64-bit type, "char" is 8-bit, and "short" is 16-bit.
- `lp64`: "long" and pointers are 64-bit long, while "int" is a 32-bit type.
  The other types remain the same as ilp32.

Compilers also implement a `ilp32e` ABI for small embedded devices, but its
standardisation status is not clear at this moment.

while the floating-point ABIs are a RISC-V specific addition:

- "" (the empty string): No floating-point arguments are passed in registers.
- `f`: 32-bit and smaller floating-point arguments are passed in registers.
  This ABI requires the F extension, as without F there are no
  floating-point registers.
- `d`: 64-bit and smaller floating-point arguments are passed in registers.
  This ABI requires the D extension.

ABI strings, possibly extended with `f` or `d`, are passed via
the `-mabi` argument to GCC. For example:

- `-march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32d`: Hardware floating-point instructions can
  be generated and floating-point arguments are passed in registers. This
  is like the `-mfloat-abi=hard` option to Arm's GCC.
- `-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32`: No floating-point instructions can be
  generated and no floating-point arguments are passed in registers. This
  is like the `-mfloat-abi=soft` argument to Arm's GCC.
- `-march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32`: Hardware floating-point instructions can
  be generated, but no floating-point arguments will be passed in
  registers. This is like the `-mfloat-abi=softfp` argument to Arm's GCC,
  and is usually used when interfacing with soft-float binaries on a
  hard-float system.
- `-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32d`: Illegal, as the ABI requires floating-point
  arguments are passed in registers but the ISA defines no floating-point
  registers to pass them in.

### `_zicsr` and `_zifencei`

Starting with 12.x, the GCC compiler
implemented the new RISC-V ISA, which introduces an incompatibility with
early compilers,
therefore it is possible that builds will throw error messages
like _unrecognized opcode `csrr`_.

The reason is that csr read/write (`csrr*`/`csrw*`)
instructions and `fence.i` instruction were separated from the `I`
extension, becoming two standalone extensions: `Zicsr` and `Zifencei`.

The solution is to add `_zicsr` and/or `_zifencei` to the
`-march` option, e.g. `-march=rv32imac` becomes
`-march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei`.

### newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option.

:::tip

For better results, this option must be
added to both the compile and link steps.

:::

### nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations of the POSIX system calls.

### `-mcmodel=medany`

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail.

:::

### Multiple libraries

Due to the large number of architectures and ABIs defined for RISC-V, not all
possible combinations are actually available.

Please check the release for the actual list.

## Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `riscv-none-elf-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

## Integration with Eclipse

**The GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** is fully integrated into
[Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io).

Eclipse provides full support for configure the RISC-V projects,
both in the build and the debug phase.

## Automated testing

In addition to integrating into regular development environments,
like Eclipse, GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC can be used for building
unit tests, in CI/CD environments.

### CMake example

The easiest way to build automated tests is with CMake in xPack applications.

For CMake cross-build projects, it is necessary to pass a
`-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
with the path to the toolchain definition.

A possible such file is
[riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/build-helper-xpack/blob/xpack/cmake/toolchains/riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake), part of the
[ÂµOS++](https://micro-os-plus.github.io)
build [helper](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/build-helper-xpack/).

:::tip Windows

Since on Windows the xPack OpenOCD uses `.cmd` forwarders, it is necessary
to explicitly define the extension, later used when invoking `openocd`:

```cmake
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(extension ".cmd")
endif()
```

:::

To run the test, the semihosted application can be directly
executed by QEMU, which provides a good RISC-V emulation.

An example of a unit test running on QEMU is:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_UNIT_TEST)

  add_executable(unit-test)
  set_target_properties(unit-test PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "unit-test")

  // ... definitions to build the application with semihosting support ...

  add_test(
    NAME "unit-test"

    COMMAND qemu-system-riscv32${extension}
    --machine virt
    --cpu rv32
    --kernel unit-test.elf
    --nographic
    -smp 1
    -bios none
    -d unimp,guest_errors
    --semihosting-config enable=on,target=native,arg=unit-test
  )

endif ()
```

In an xPack application, the tests can be invoked by running an xPack action,
like this:

```sh
xpm run test
```

This asssumes that in `package.json` there is an action named `test`
and that all required tools were previously installed:

```json
{
  "...": "...",

  "xpack": {
    "actions": {
      "...": "...",
      "test": "ctest -V"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": "3.26.5-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build": "1.11.1-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv": "8.2.2-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc": "12.3.1-1.2.1"
    }
  }
}
```

The xPack action runs the defined command (`ctest -V` in this case)
in an environment where `xpacks/.bin` is prepended to the PATH, so
the tools installed locally by **xpm** are available and prefered to
possibly other similar tools installed in the system, thus
achieving a good reproducibility.
