### Disclaimer

The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC is only a binary distribution of
the GNU GCC,
and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing problems.

If you have questions/suggestions related to the procedure used to
build/publish the binary distribution, continue reading the next sections.

If you have problems related to RISC-V GCC functionality, please use the
official GCC support channels.
